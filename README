The func_as_at_23012011.xml is the current output of the parser. You'll want to run it afresh
to get a really up-to-date function list by downloading the PHP manual and running
this parser. Or you might be happy to put up with this old one, in which case, download it, and you don't
need to run any of this code at all...

This is my repair of a technique for generating a function list for phpm from
the work of the PHP Documentation project. I was working on old,
unmaintained code from from the Web Archive. If it still works, the
link to the source:
http://web.archive.org/web/20041206211514/phpvolcano.com/articles/manual/index.php

I include a wget of the file in doc/ in case it is pulled.

My repairs basically amount to mending the parser which used getChild()
incorrectly - this was probably supported in PHP4 when the article
was first written, but the new DirectoryIteratorIterator() method
should be used instead. In other words, I've solved SamPeng's problem
in his 26/03/2009 comment on http://eide.org/2009/01/02/phpm/

Credit is due to the original author of the code, I suspect HÃ¥vard Eide
http://eide.org but I'm afraid I'm not sure and haven't the time to
research it...

BTW, it isn't just enough to run this code. You need to follow through the
article in doc/ in order to understand
1) what to run it on
2) what to do next to get phpm working on your system

All the best!
